1. problem: 
	find if there is a path between two objects. If there is a path, the two objects relates to each other.
2. Graph 
	draw the graph to illustrate and find the pattern
3. Design a Data Structure to hold the data
	(1) data structure:
		The WeightedQuickUnionUF class represents a union¨Cfind data type, 
 		The union¨Cfind data type models connectivity among a set of n sites/objects, named 0 through n¨C1.
 	(2) data members:
 		int[] id;
 	(3) Methods:
 		It supports the union and find operations,
4.  algorithm analysis
	(1) time-complexity, fast enough?
	(2) space-complexity, fits the memory?
5. draw a UML diagram
6. sudo code
7. implementation of the data structure using real code
8. real time imeplementation
